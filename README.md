# voice-assistent
Well, I had the similar thought before I started making my very own “Digital” Personal Assistant. Though it is
not as capable and high as like Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant, Home or Apple’s Siri or JARVIS from
Iron Man. Nowadays, People are troubled by typing commands into the computer. Be it procrastination or a
busy schedule. Typing is a big obsolete process. The solution to this is that we switch over to an assistant which
understands us and do the initial work for us. An assistant is the best replacement for typing commands.
It’s named as Desktop Voice Assistant NOVA with Voice Recognition Intelligence, which takes the user input
in form of user’s voice and processes it and return the output in various ways like an action to be performed or
the search result is speaked out to the end user.
